                <strong>Var: </strong> Var declarations were the standard before
                ES6 was introduced. However, variables declared with var are not
                without problems.

                <ol>
                  <li>The scope of a var variable is functional scope.</li>
                  <li>It can be updated and re-declared into the scope.</li>
                  <li>It can be declared without initialization.</li>
                  <li>It can be accessed without initialization as its default value is “undefined”.</li>
                </ol>
                
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Let: </strong> let is now preferred for variable declaration. It's no surprise as it comes as an improvement to var declarations. It also solves the problem with var.
                <ol>
                  <li>The scope of a let variable is block scope.</li>
                  <li>It can be updated but cannot be re-declared into the scope.</li>
                  <li>It can be declared without initialization.</li>
                  <li>It cannot be accessed without initialization otherwise it will give ‘referenceError’.</li>

              <p>
                <strong>Const: </strong> Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. const declarations share some similarities with let declarations.

                  <li>The scope of a const variable is block scope.</li>

                  <li>It cannot be accessed without initialization, as it cannot be declared without initialization.</li>

              <p>Null and undefined, though commonly interpreted as the same, differ in a few ways.
                <br>
                Null: The value is purposefully left out. It is one of JavaScript's basic values. null is a special value in JavaScript that represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is often used when you want to explicitly set a variable to have no value or when an object property should be empty. Here’s an example: <br>

                let emptyVariable = null; <br>
                
                console.log(emptyVariable); // Output: null <br>
                <br>
                Undefined: It indicates that the value is missing from the compiler. It is the world's object. undefined is another special value in JavaScript that represents a variable that has not been assigned a value. When you declare a variable without assigning any value to it, JavaScript automatically assigns the value undefined. Here’s an example: <br>

                let uninitializedVariable; <br>
                
                console.log(uninitializedVariable); // Output: undefined 
                <br>
                
                Null: Object 
                <br>
                Undefined: Undefined
                <br>
                null == undefined // true <br>
                null === undefined // false <br>
                It indicates that null and undefined are equivalent but distinct. <br>
                
                We are attempting to communicate that a variable does not exist when we define it to undefined. We are attempting to communicate that a variable is empty when we define it to null.</p>

              <p>Web services can be accessed with ease using a REST API. The server will send a representation of the requested resource's state to the client when a RESTful API is invoked. A RESTful API uses defined base URLs and methods to carry out the operations necessary to modify, add, or remove data. It is stateless, isolates client-server concerns, and for client-side data caching.
                <br>
                An API that complies with the representational state transfer, or REST, architectural style's design principles is known as a REST API. Because of this, REST APIs are also known as RESTful APIs.
                <br>
                Example: <br>
                <code>
                  {
                    "user1" : {
